differences between user behaviours as event counts are essentially compared on percentages of time across users . as can be seen in the above figure , the generated user event vectors are sparse , but by having the split length parametrized , the sparsity of the vectors can be adjusted , which ultimately removes sparsity in the vector .", "of course this is greatly dependent on the rate of user events of a particular company .", "event vectors , with adequate sparsity , can be generated from a company with a very high rate of events , by using a small split length .", "similarly extending the split length can benefit user event vectors of a company with not a lot of user activity .", "thus it can be said that the split length parameter needs to be selected through trial and error , so that denser user event vectors can be generated with more pattern information .", "now that the proposed representation has been defined , the following step was to decide how to label these representations . through their experience", ", framed has realized that almost 81% of the companies they deal with have no event implemented to signify the churning of a user @xcite .", "thus output values needed to be generated through some kind of logic that would determine if a user has churned based on the given data . using the logic described in @xcite ,", "a user would be deemed as a churner if there were no events triggered for a specific number of consecutive days . due to the inherent business model of subscription companies to bill their customers on a monthly basis ,", "it was decided that 30 days of inactivity would be a good threshold to signify user churn .", "this is because a whole month of inactivity means a loss in revenue for these companies , therefore a churner would have to be identified before they become inactive .", "the concept of time split s used to generate the user event input vectors was also used to implement this logic . since data from a company was divided into splits of a selected split length , data from subsequent splits could be used to determine the output value of a previous splits user event vector .", "this logic can be better demonstrated through figure 13 which shows the complete development of training and validation / test sets .", "the above figure shows the overall logic of using the proposed representation architecture to generate training , validation and test sets across 90 days worth of company data for a set split length of 30 days ( split length can be varied ) .", "let @xmath54 indicate consecutive 30 day splits .", "initially @xmath55 data is used to generate user event vectors for each user present within the time interval of @xmath55 .", "then the combined data from @xmath55 and @xmath56 is used to compute churn output values for every user in the combined time interval of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .", "the output values are calculated based on the time difference between the time of a users last triggered event and the final time of @xmath56 .", "if this time difference is greater than 30 days , then a 1 is returned as an output value ( indicating churn ) , otherwise a 0 is returned ( indicating an active user ) .", "furthermore , in the case that a users overall event time span throughout @xmath55 and @xmath56 is found to be less than 30 days ( which would indicate a new user ) , a -1 is returned .", "this is important as a company would not be interested in keeping new users but rather retain long active users .", "therefore any users with a value of -1 are filtered out .", "the user event vectors generated for @xmath55 are joined with the generated output values based on their user ids .", "this is done as we are only interested in the output values of users in the time interval of @xmath55 and thus any other users that have registered after @xmath55 are not included .", "therefore the end result will be a complete dataset for @xmath55 with user event input vectors and churn output values .", "since the overall aim of generating these representations is to effectively train deep neural networks to predict churn rather than just identifying what input vectors indicate churn , the deep neural network should be validated and tested on a following splits dataset .", "this is also demonstrated in figure 13 , as the whole process of generating a dataset for @xmath55 is repeated for @xmath56 , using @xmath57 to generate its output values .", "therefore the final result will be a dataset for @xmath55 and a dataset for @xmath56 .", "the dataset generated for @xmath55 would be used to train a deep neural network while the dataset generated for @xmath56 would be further sub divided into validation and test sets ( 50% - 50% random split ) .", "thus this ultimately would force the deep neural network to find a function that could predict churn on @xmath56 data representations based on @xmath55 data representations .", "this is key in enforcing prediction rather than just identification of data representations .    due to the inherent nature of the problem of churn prediction ,", "generated datasets will be imbalanced in terms of samples available for their respective output value classes .", "this is because customer churn will usually be a rare event .", "this can cause serious issues in prediction performance @xcite , as a model will adjust its parameters to fit the majority class while disregarding the minority class .", "in order to address this issue , generated training , validation and test sets were balanced using random under - sampling .", "this method randomly removes samples from the majority class until the samples of each class are balanced .", "naturally this may cause the loss of a considerable amount of majority samples that can contribute to better separation between the two classes , but this was the only identified technique that would not cause model overfitting .", "initially the generation of datasets was attempted using python and various scipy ecosystem packages such as numpy and pandas . even after boosting the performance of certain iterations in the developed script by using multithreading python techniques , dataset generation based on the proposed data representation architecture ,", "could not be realized on a single machine .", "this was mainly due to the massive sizes of the raw - dump daily json event files which in turn caused extremely long iteration times . therefore other technologies needed to be investigated that could generate these datasets as fast as possible and irrespective of how many days of data were selected .", "it was decided that a spark computational cluster would be used as the literature stated that it could be up to 100x faster than a hadoop mapreduce system ( if there is enough system memory ) .", "framed graciously provided access to a compute engine project on the google cloud platform in order build the spark cluster . compute engine projects allow a user to create high performance virtual machines of various computational and memory specifications . by initializing a number of such virtual machines and by consequently installing spark and hadoop ( hdfs ) proprietary software on each one", ", they could be configured to work together as a computational cluster .    before any building of the cluster could commence , the general architecture of the cluster needed to be considered . since", "a compute engine project will only allow a maximum of 24 computational cores to be utilized across all virtual machines , it was decided that the spark driver ( master ) would be based on a virtual machine with 8 cores and 16 spark workers ( slaves ) will be based on single core virtual machines .", "this setup would allow for maximum computational performance while also allowing for a very powerful master server to perform any non - cluster data operations .", "furthermore it was decided that an hdfs architecture should be incorporated with sparks architecture so that no additional virtual machines would need to be created .", "this was done by having the master virtual machine be both a spark driver and an hdfs namenode .", "thus the remaining 16 slave virtual machines would also serve a dual purpose , as they would be both a spark worker and an hdfs datanode .", "the final architecture can be visualized in figure 14 .        before any virtual machine instantiation , a virtual network needed to be created that would allow all the machines to operate under the same ip range .", "furthermore this was important as the computational cluster needed special firewall entries to allow tcp , udp and icmp protocols to be used for communication between them .", "thus by creating a virtual network these firewall rules could be applied internally within the compute engine without any concerns for outside security threats that could arise by enabling them .", "therefore each virtual machine instance was created on this virtual network following the specifications described in the architecture .", "it was important that all instances were working on the same operating system so that software installations could be carried out the same way across all machines .", "the chosen operating system was ubuntu 14.04 lts as it was a stable release of the popular linux distribution .", "after all the virtual machines were instantiated , java and the java development kit were installed on the all the machines , as both spark and hadoop hdfs require java to operate .", "spark allows for the possibility to operate in standalone mode .", "this means that it does not require the installation of third party cluster managers ( yarn or mesos ) in order for it to function .", "this can be achieved by installing a compiled version of spark on each machine .", "spark installations provide scripts that can be run in order to configure a cluster .", "a master server can be launched using the _", "`` start-master.sh '' _", "script and a slave server can be assigned to a master server using the _", "`` start-slave.sh ''", "_ script followed by the ip of the master server .", "this process can be accelerated by adding the ips of all slave servers to a _", "`` slaves '' _ file in the master servers configuration and consequently running the _", "`` start-all.sh '' _ script on the master server .", "in order for any of these scripts to work , password - less secure shell ( ssh ) access needed to be established between a master server and all slave servers .", "this was done by generating private and public ssh keys on the master server and by sequentially transferring these ssh keys to all slave servers .", "this allowed two - way communication between the master server and slave servers .", "finally , after further configuration in the master servers spark configuration files regarding environment variables , spark was initialized using the _ `` start-all.sh '' _ script on the master server .    to extend the capacity of the proposed architecture , additional 500 gb drives were attached on each of the slave virtual machines", "this was done using the google cloud sdk which allows for quick access and control of all projects in the google cloud platform with simple shell commands . after attaching the drives to the slave virtual machines ,", "the drives were mounted on each slaves operating system in identical directories .", "the directories would be used to hold the blocks of split data files within the hdfs .    having everything set up , the next stage was to tailor the proposed data representations script so that it can utilize the spark computational cluster .", "essentially the script was re- written using the pyspark api which exposes the spark programming model to python .", "in other words rdd transformations could be executed through this api by supplying python functions to the transformation methods , which would subsequently return python collection types if a spark `` action '' is executed on a transformation .", "thus most of the scripts logic was split into functions that could be easily passed into rdd transformations , by following the respective transformation arguments and return prerequisites .", "the example shown in figure 15 , depicts an algorithm that can be implemented in python and subsequently passed into a spark @xmath47 transformation .", "after a `` raw - dump '' files data has been loaded as text elements in an rdd , the `` getselecteddata '' function can be performed through the @xmath47 transformation .", "this will return a new rdd where every text element in the original rdd , has been transformed into a tuple of @xmath58 .", "this is in fact is the first step discussed in the encompassing data representations architecture , where required information was scrapped json event objects .", "the above methodology was applied to all procedures required to generate datasets of the discussed representation architecture .", "intuitively a directed acyclic graph could be visualized from the performed transformations which would give better context to the overall way the spark script works .", "figure 16 , illustrates how all the procedures needed to retrieve event vector to churn output mappings of the proposed data representation architecture , can be performed through spark transformations in a directed acyclic graph .", "transformations are illustrated as ovals and actions are illustrated as rectangles .", "the mapping for @xmath55 is consequently used to generate the training set , while the mapping for @xmath56 will be further subdivided to generate validation and test sets .", "of course further procedures are performed in order to generate the final dataset from the two resulting mappings ( like dataset balancing ) , but due to the fact that most of the processing is performed on the spark cluster the complete process is extremely fast .", "implementing a deep network architecture can be impossible if attempted to be done without a way of expressing and computing mathematical expressions programmatically .", "furthermore the programming language needs to be extremely fast in its computations as during the training phase of a neural network , a lot of different computations need to be performed ( cost function calculations , gradient estimations etc . ) .", "theano has long been recognised as an effective python library in implementing deep neural networks , especially in research @xcite .", "it allows the definition , optimization and evaluation of mathematical expressions of arbitrary complexity .", "once a mathematical function has be expressed and evaluation is initiated , theano will compile the function into c code and automatically optimize the generated c code so that when it is evaluated , the computation is extremely fast .", "furthermore theano allows for gpu acceleration for its computations using the nvidia cuda api .", "the advantage that ultimately led to the adoption of theano in this project , was that the library can automatically perform differentiation on a function .", "this simplified the backpropagation algorithm greatly .", "theano uses special objects in order to effectively express any function .", "the most basic object is the tensor object which essentially is a representation of the type of an expected input .", "for example let s assume that the function @xmath59 needed to be expressed in theano .", "variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined as tensor objects of type scalar . in other words", "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are expected to have integers as inputs .", "subsequently variable @xmath62 can be defined as the operation to be performed on @xmath60 and @xmath61 .", "finally the complete function is expressed as having @xmath60 and @xmath61 as inputs and @xmath62 as the expected operation to be performed .", "thus any function can be easily expressed by a combination of input tensors and a single expression of the expected operation .    in order to better understand how", "theano can be used to implement deep neural networks , several deep learning tutorials from the university of montreal were implemented as practice ( found here @xcite ) .", "these included logistic regression using a single artificial neuron up to the implementation of a multilayer perceptron ( deep feed - forward architecture ) .", "the tutorials covered how theano could be used to implement layers in a deep feed - forward network and how these layer objects could be easily stacked and trained using stochastic gradient descent on the popular mnist dataset @xcite .", "having realised the basic concepts of how various deep neural network mechanics could be implemented , it was decided that the deep learning architecture to be implemented would be based on the tutorial examples .    since the only paper describing the application of deep learning in churn prediction ,", "had proposed a deep feed - forward architecture , it was decided that such an architecture should be adopted .", "as mentioned in the paper , hyperbolic tangent activation neurons were used in their architecture .", "having that said , background research suggested that the recently developed rectified linear activation neuron could allow for better backpropagation gradient estimations .", "furthermore background research suggested the use of dropout could allow for better generalization in deep architectures .", "thus it was decided that both these mechanics would have to be implemented so that the final architecture could benefit from these techniques .        after following the theano tutorials ,", "it was decided that four different classes needed to be created .", "the classes are depicted in the uml class diagram in figure 17 .", "the most basic class is the _ linearhiddenlayer _ , its main function is to generate the basic structure of a layer in an architecture using the _", "`` n_in '' _ and _ `` n_out '' _ ( neurons in , neurons out ) arguments to generate an array of shape @xmath63 and then assign the array values to a _", "`` theano.shared '' _ variable .", "shared variables allow information to be copied onto the gpu and provide access to their contents to all theano functions , so that information is not constantly copied on the gpu in order to perform computations ( severe decrease in performance ) .", "the array is randomly instantiated based on a random uniform distribution and essentially represents the weight values of a layer .", "the bias vector is instantiated in a similar way but instead , it is instantiated with zeros .", "lastly the output parameter is expressed as the dot product between the input argument and the weights plus the bias .", "the _ linearhiddenlayer _ class is extended into the reludropoutlayer class whose basic function is to apply the rectified linear activation on the output parameter of the _ linearhiddenlayer _ subclass .", "the output of the _ reludropoutlayer _ class is expressed as a dropout function applied on the now activated layer ( dropout function is discussed later on ) .", "in addition to the dropout hidden layers , the output layer of the architecture required a @xmath22 layer as its output in order to be able to act as a classifier . a _ softmaxlayer _", "class was implemented to serve this purpose .", "its weights and bias parameters are instantiated with zeros and similar to the _ linearhiddenlayer _ class are assigned to shared variables . the parameter _", "`` probability_of_class_given_input '' _ parameter is expressed through a _", "`` theano.softmax '' _ function which takes the dot product of its weights and its input and during computation will return the probability of an input belonging to a certain class . in order for the architecture to be able to make predictions , the _", "`` predict_y '' _ parameter is instantiated as an expression through the use of the _", "`` theano.argmax '' _ function which during computation will return the index of the neuron which has the highest probability .", "finally the _ softmaxlayer _ class has two methods .", "the _ negative_log_likelihood _ returns an expression of the architectures cost function based on the classes parameters and a given label vector @xmath61 .", "the errors method returns an expression to compute the zero - one - loss of the layers prediction against a given label vector @xmath61 .", "this is all brought together under the _ dropoutmlp _ class .", "the class example in figure 17 demonstrates a _ dropoutmlp _ class of 4 layers .", "the main function of the _ dropoutmlp _ is to stack _ reludropoutlayer _ classes and at the end apply a _ softmaxlayer_. the first hidden layer takes as input the input vectors from the data representation architecture .", "subsequently the second hidden layer takes the first hidden layers output as input and finally the output layer takes as input the second hidden layers output .", "it has to be noticed that the size of the hidden layers is intuitively assigned as a parameter by controlling the dimensions of each layers weight matrices .", "since dropout is used in this architecture , l1 and l2 regularizations are applied only in the output layer and the values are respectfully computed as separate parameters . finally the _ dropoutmlp _ class takes the output layers negative log likelihood method and assigns the expression as the cost parameter .", "similarly the errors parameter takes the output layers error method expression .", "the _ dropoutmlp _ object can now be effectively be trained by creating theano functions that can train , validate and test the objects architecture using its public parameters in a backpropagation algorithm .", "the implemented backpropagation algorithm was essentially an altered stochastic gradient descent algorithm from the tutorial with an added momentum technique . having that said ,", "the theano tutorials did not show how the dropout technique could be implemented or how the activation function for rectified linear neurons could be implemented .", "furthermore the tutorials only demonstrated stochastic gradient descent without a momentum parameter . thus these techniques needed to be implemented based on the research paper descriptions of each technique .", "the rectified linear unit activation was implemented by expressing a function in theano that could be applied on a layers pre - activation matrix ( the dot product of the weight matrix and the input values ) such that only the maximum of a theano tensor object would be returned . to implement dropout , a function", "was created that would allow only a proportion of the activations of a layer to be passed on to the next layer .", "the function can do this by generating an array of a randomized binomial distribution of 1 trial , of the same size of a layers activation matrix .", "the result of the binomial distribution is controlled by a parameter @xmath42 which corresponds to the probability of a neuron not dropping out ( indicated by a 1 in the array ) .", "thus the end result would be an array of ones and zeros of the exact same size as the activation matrix . by multiplying the array with the activation matrix ,", "effectively only the results where a one is present will be returned .", "this function could be applied in any layers activation matrix and could demonstrate dropout .", "having that said , dropout needs to be only applied during the training phase of a deep architecture . simply adding this function to a layers class would not work as dropout will be constantly performed . therefore a modification needed to be made in a dropout layers class such that dropout is only performed during training .", "this was done by using the theano _", "`` tensor.switch '' _ method which returns a variable depending on a conditions validity . by having the condition being _", "`` is_training '' _ ( boolean variable ) and by having that condition altered during the run time of the backpropagation algorithm , dropout could be switched on and off based on what phase the deep learning architecture was performing .    in order to implement momentum the expression of the _ `` updates '' _", "parameter of the theano train function needed to be altered .", "the _ `` updates '' _", "parameter of the theano train function essentially supplies the train function with an expression based on the weights of the architecture , which describes how the weights will be updated .", "thus every time the train function is run , the weights of the architecture will be updated based on the result of the train function ( cost ) and the update expression supplied .", "momentum can be incorporated in the update expression by firstly creating a theano shared variable which essentially keeps track of each weight update across every iteration .", "then the update expression was altered by incorporating a momentum parameter and having that parameter multiplied with the previous weight updates .", "this was subsequently added to the normal weight update expression where the learning rate is multiplied with the derivatives of the cost function with respect to each weight .", "as mentioned previously gradient derivation can be done automatically in theano using the _", "`` tensor.grad '' _ method by supplying it with the cost function and the weights .", "furthermore during the end of every iteration the momentum parameter would need to be increased and kept under one while the learning rate would need to be decayed , so that correct gradient descent can be performed .", "this was done by instantiating two more theano shared variables with the initial momentum and learning rate values . therefore at the end of every iteration these shared variables were updated with their respective updated values . momentum was increased by 2% after every iteration until it reached 0.99 , while the learning rate was decayed by 1.5% after every iteration .", "this is known as learning rate annealing in gradient descent algorithms with momentum , and it is said to guarantee convergence to a minimum @xcite .    therefore the final implemented

two neurons ( one for each class ) .", "this layer is regularized using l1 and l2 regularization .", "the architecture also has a dropout technique implemented during its training which should allow
